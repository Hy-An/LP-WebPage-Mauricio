            Chester Charles Bennington was an American singer, songwriter, and
            occasional actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist for Linkin
            Park and was also lead vocalist for the bands Grey Daze, Dead by
            Sunrise and, between 2013 and 2015, Stone Temple Pilots. Bennington
            has been credited by several publications as one of the greatest
            rock vocalists of his generation. Bennington first gained prominence
            as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album
            Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The
            album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of
            America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the
            decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many
            sales. Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to
            One More Light (2017), continued the band's success. Bennington
            formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The
            band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009.
            He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release
            the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own
            record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin
            Park.

            Bradford Phillip Delson (born December 1, 1977) is an American
            musician and record producer, best known as the lead guitarist and
            one of the founding members of the American rock band Linkin Park.
            Brad Delson attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, an affluent
            suburb of Los Angeles, with childhood friend and Linkin Park
            bandmate Mike Shinoda. He played in various bands throughout his
            high school career, the most notable being Relative Degree, in which
            he met and teamed up with drummer Rob Bourdon. Relative Degree's
            goal was simply to play a show and after achieving that goal, they
            disbanded. After graduating in 1995, Delson, Shinoda and Bourdon
            formed Xero, which would eventually become the starting point for
            Linkin Park. Delson entered UCLA in 1995 as a Regents' Scholar
            working toward a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication Studies
            with a specialization in Business and Administration. He shared a
            dorm room with future Linkin Park bandmate Dave Farrell for three
            out of his four years at school. Delson also had the opportunity to
            intern with a member of the music industry as part of his studies
            and ended up working for Jeff Blue, an A&R representative at Warner
            Bros. Records, who offered constructive criticism on Xero's demos,
            which were from the 4-track sampler tape Xero, which was released in
            1996. Blue later introduced Chester Bennington, who would become the
            lead vocalist of Linkin Park, to the rest of the band. After
            graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA in 1999,
            Delson decided to forgo law school in order to pursue a musical
            career with Linkin Park.
