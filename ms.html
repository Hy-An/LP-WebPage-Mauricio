            Michael Kenji Shinoda (篠田 賢治, Shinoda Kenji, born February 11,
            1977) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, rapper, record
            producer, and graphic designer. He co-founded Linkin Park in 1996
            and is one of the band's vocalists, as well as rhythm guitarist,
            keyboardist, primary songwriter and producer. Shinoda later created
            a hip-hop-driven side project, Fort Minor, in 2004. He has also
            served as a producer for tracks and albums by Lupe Fiasco, Styles of
            Beyond and the X-Ecutioners. Born in Panorama City, California and
            raised in Agoura Hills, Shinoda formed Xero, which later became
            Linkin Park, with two of his high school friends: Brad Delson and
            Rob Bourdon in 1996, later joined by Joe Hahn, Dave Farrell and Mark
            Wakefield. Chester Bennington replaced Wakefield as the lead
            vocalist in 1999. The band later signed a record deal with Warner
            Bros Records. Shinoda is also the co-founder of Machine Shop
            Records, a California-based record label. Outside of music, Shinoda
            is an artist and graphic designer. He has painted several pieces of
            artwork, some of which have been featured in the Japanese American
            National Museum.
